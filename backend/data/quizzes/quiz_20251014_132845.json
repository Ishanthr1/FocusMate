      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "When adding 47 and 38, first add the ones column (7 + 8 = 15). Write down 5 and carry over 1 to the tens column. Then add the tens column (4 + 3 + 1 (carried over) = 8). The total is 85."

        "D) 371"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Add the numbers column by column: 3 + 9 = 12 (write 2, carry 1). 2 + 4 + 1 (carried) = 7. 1 + 2 = 3. So, 123 + 249 = 372."
