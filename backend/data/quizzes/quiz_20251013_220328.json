    {
      "question": "The derivative of a function at a point represents the slope of the tangent line to the function's graph at that point.",

        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "True",

        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "True",
      "explanation": "According to the power rule for differentiation, d/dx (x^n) = nx^(n-1)."

        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "True",
      "explanation": "Definite integrals are specifically used to calculate the area between a function's graph and the x-axis over a given interval."

        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "True",
      "explanation": "Integrating 2x with respect to x gives x^2, and 'C' represents the constant of integration for indefinite integrals."

      "question": "A limit describes the value a function approaches as the input approaches some value, regardless of whether the function is defined at that exact point.",

        "False"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "True",
      "explanation": "This is the core concept of a limit in calculus, focusing on the behavior of the function near a point."
