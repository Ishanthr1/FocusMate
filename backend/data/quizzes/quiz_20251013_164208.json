    {
      "question": "The derivative of a constant function is always zero.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "True",
      "explanation": "For any constant c, the rate of change is zero, so d/dx(c) = 0."
    },
    {
      "question": "The power rule for differentiation states that d/dx(x^n) = nx^(n-1).",

        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "True",
      "explanation": "This is the fundamental power rule used to differentiate functions of the form x raised to a power."

    {
      "question": "The indefinite integral of 2x with respect to x is x^2 + C.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "True",
      "explanation": "Using the power rule for integration, \u222bx^n dx = (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C. So, \u222b2x dx = 2 * (x^(1+1))/(1+1) + C = 2 * (x^2)/2 + C = x^2 + C."
    },
    {
      "question": "If a function is differentiable at a point, it must also be continuous at that point.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "True",
      "explanation": "Differentiability implies continuity. A function cannot have a derivative at a point where it is discontinuous (e.g., a jump, hole, or vertical asymptote)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Integration is the mathematical process of finding the instantaneous rate of change of a function.",

        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "False",
      "explanation": "Finding the instantaneous rate of change is the process of differentiation. Integration is the process of finding the accumulation or the antiderivative of a function."
